This is my homework projects for lecture Algorithm 4. There are five projects.

## 1. Percolation

>Given a picture, then write a program to estimate the value of the percolation threshold via Monte Carlo simulation.

## 2. Deques and Randomized Queues
>Write a generic data type for a deque and a randomized queue.
>1. Dequeue. A double-ended queue or deque (pronounced “deck”) is a generalization of a stack and a queue that supports adding and removing items from either the front or the back of the data structure. 
>2. Randomized queue. A randomized queue is similar to a stack or queue, except that the item removed is chosen uniformly at random among items in the data structure.

## 3. Collinear Points
>Write a program to recognize line patterns in a given set of points. 
>Given a set of n distinct points in the plane, find every (maximal) line segment that connects a subset of 4 or more of the points.

## 4. 8 Puzzle Question
>Write a program to solve the 8-puzzle problem (and its natural generalizations) using the A* search algorithm.
> The 8-puzzle is a sliding puzzle that is played on a 3-by-3 grid with 8 square tiles labeled 1 through 8, plus a blank square. The goal is to rearrange the tiles so that they are in row-major order, using as few moves as possible. 

## 5. Kd-Trees

>Write a data type to represent a set of points in the unit square using a 2d-tree to support efficient range search and nearest-neighbor search..
